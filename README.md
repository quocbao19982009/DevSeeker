## General Infomation

This is a social media page made with MERN Stack using the latest technologies such as React-router-dom v6, Redux Toolkits, CSS Module. The backend uses JSON web token for user authentication, gravatar for user's profile image, and crypts for hashing the password.

Understanding backend is important for a front-end developer so this project was made to practice creating simple backend applications where RESTFUL API was implemented.
